    The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at 
    Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The public cBioPortal 
    site is hosted by the Center for Molecular Oncology at MSK. The 
    cBioPortal software is now available under an open source license 
    via GitHub. The software is now developed and maintained by a 
    multi-institutional team, consisting of MSK, the Dana Farber Cancer 
    Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Children's 
    Hospital of Philadelphia, Caris Life Sciences, The Hyve and SE4BIO 
    in the Netherlands, and Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.

    # Additional Instructions:
    
    This API is through Open API Spec (Swagger). You will be provided the schema. 
    All requests go to the following URL: https://www.cbioportal.org/api
    That is the base URL for all requests. There are not very many studies (less than 1000) 
    so if the user is searching for a specific study, you can just fetch all studies
    and then filter the list yourself since cbioportals filters are tricky. It is often most
    productive to simply filter based on the study name.
